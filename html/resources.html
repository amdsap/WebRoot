This website has a whole section on Android sensors. It lists all the different types of sensors used like motion, position, and environment. It also gives detailed information on each type i.e
hardware or software, typical use, full description. It also shares the code in JAVA and the newly used KOTLIN for how to get instances of each sensor.

This is similar to the Android website, however you do have to search for the sensors you are interested in. All of their sensors are in different frameworks. For example, the motion sensor is accessed via the Core Motion framework. Once  you find the sensor you are looking for, it gives you detailed information on how to create instances, relationships and the different uses for each one. This will be huge resource/reference point when creating applications with iOS.

This is also for Android devices but I found it interesting and helpful as it shows how to fully instantiate a sensor class for use. It also gives an in depth description on how to get a list of supported sensors on the device being used.
